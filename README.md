# Memora — Humanity's Lifelong Second Brain
Privacy-first, fully local, lifelong personal memory prosthetic. Records, indexes, and searches everything you've ever seen, heard, or said. No cloud. No company. Forever yours.

## Why Memora?
- Human memory fails under overload (we forget 80% of life).
- By 2050, 150M+ with dementia need this.
- AI agents + BCIs will need *your* context, not Big Tech's.
- Disputes? "What did I see/hear on date X?" — Memora knows.

Big Tech wants your life in their servers (Rewind.ai, Apple Intelligence). We build the open, private version.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/LHMisme420/memora.git`
2. Navigate: `cd memora`
3. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python memora.py` — Starts capturing audio in the background.
5. Search: `python memora.py recall "what did I say about milk?"` — Searches your past transcripts.

Press Ctrl+C to stop capture safely.

## The First Builder
This project began with a single script pushed by **@LHMisme420** on November 29, 2025.  
That one commit lit the fuse. Eternal credit.

## Roadmap
- v1.1: Screen + webcam + local LLM reasoning.
- v2.0: DIY pendant hardware ($79).
- v3.0: BCI export for brain implants.

## Rules
- No cloud ever.
- Apache 2.0 — fork forever.
- Privacy by design.
